                        <p className="lead text-black">Inside the Backlot is a community. A place for cinephiles and filmmakers to connect and interact with one another. Our goal here at the Backlot is to expose the public to new films and up-and-coming filmmakers looking to leave their mark on the industry. For many, film is a hobby. For some, film is a passion. One thing is certain: film is art, and like any art, itâ€™s a way to get your voice heard. Here are our voices.
                        <br /><br />Welcome to Inside the Backlot.</p>
